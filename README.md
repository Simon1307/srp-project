## Overview

This project is an end-to-end machine learning application that transforms regular input images into art pieces inspired by the style of Claude Monet by employing the CycleGAN model for image-to-image translation.

This project builds upon CycleGAN. The model is trained within the project using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which you can download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/your-username/dataset-name). To integrate the dataset into the project for training, follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.
2. Unzip the downloaded archive.
3. Move the dataset folder in the working directory of this repository.
